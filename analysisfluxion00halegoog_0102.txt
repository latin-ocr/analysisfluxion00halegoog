territe Paiae's eulogy on securem-Ant how wretched, how delusrve the
happiness she cao afford, dctached from Recrorou-rhat true mistress os the

..⁶⁶ To be happy in old age,’' says Paine, “ it is necessary that we· accustom
outlelves to objecls that can accumpany the ,mind all the way through liser and
that we calte the rest ar guod in their dau. The mere man ospleasure is miserahle
iu olel age 3 and· the mere drndgc in lufiuess is hur little better: whereas Natural
Philosophy, iliatheuaricol and ddechanicus Scieucer, are a continual source ol tranquil
plausere. And, in spite of the gloonty dogmas of Priesss and admonitione

and aduenire the Carrion: fot· the principles of Science are in the Creatiou, are
anchangeable and of auaeotgtnt’

at the close of his days, thus lound to his eost, that he had been all his life

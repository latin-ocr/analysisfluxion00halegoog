DE SENSORIO ET DE Vl SENTIENDI.

· ¹5¹· Qantara tragedias excitavit haec vox technica seryorium! Reclamant
Leibrrirzr'arri .· “ Maurorum hle habes reum confitentem, et vim sentiendi omnem
ex cauus mechanicis solventem l ''

s sSed ipsum audiamus, de industria definientem hanc vocem, “ the place of
malron.'’ .

“ Is not the senstrry of animale that place to which the sentirive substance is
present, and into which rhe sensrble species os things 'are carried through the
nerves and brain; rhat there they might be perceived by their immediate pre· ἱ

sence to that substerne ?’'

And this distinslion between the argens ofseryatr‘rn and the sersttive substante
itself was long ago noticed ny Socrates, in the Phrada of Plato, thus ridiculing

the Meclariral P ilustrphists o his day ε

, “ Itis true indeed, that without bones and nervas, and such other urgant as 1
poffess, it would be impolstble to all* asl thought fir, but to all'ert that Ι do ¹
what Ι do by their agenr), and not stom chorreos the best, would be downright
absurdity, and a mode of argument truly ritlieulous.’'-Thus nobly stating his
decided choice, rather to remain, and submitto the unjust sentence of the
Athenian Judger, than to save his lise by escaping ro Megara, and secking an
asylum among the Baeorr'ans. l

Bm was this preference merely the result of vibrariunculae of the hrain?

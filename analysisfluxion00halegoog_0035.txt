‘⁶ Alselare insrnity, as such, can hardly be the objedl either of our conceptions
or calculations; hut relative infinity may, under a proper re'gulation. Our
author observes this distinction very llriclly, and introduces none hut infinilely
liele tpnntitles that are relative& so: which he arrives at, by beginning ulth
finite quanrltles, and proceedlng hy a gradual and necessary Progress ol dinti-

nuuon : his computatione always commcnce by finire ancl r'ntel'r'gllle quantities3 '

ancl then, at lall, he inquires what ulll be the result, in certain circumstances,
uben sochor such quantlties are dlminlshed r'n infinitam.' This is a constant prac-
tice cren in Canmon Algebra ancl Geometry; and is no more than descending srcnn·
